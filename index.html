   <p>ghbors start to gossip and drool
    He cries oh girl you must be mad
    What happened to the sweet love you and me had
    Against the door he leans and start a scene
    And his tears fall and burn the garden green
    And so castles made of sand
    Fall in the sea
    Eventually
    A little Indian brave who before he was ten
    Played wargames in the woods with his Indian friends
    And he built a dream that when he grew up
    He would be a fearless warrior Indian chief
    Many moons past and more the dream grew strong
    Until tomorrow he would sing his first war song
    And fight his first battle
    But something went wrong
    Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night
    And so castles made of sand
    Fall in the sea
    Eventually
    There was a young girl
    Whose heart was a frown
    'Cause she was crippled for life
    And she couldn't speak a sound
    And she wished and prayed
    She could stop livin'
    So she decide to die
    She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
    And to her legs she smiled
    You won't hurt me no more
    But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
    Look a golden winged ship is passing my way
    And it really didn't have to stop
    It just kept on going
    And so castles made of sand
    Slips into the sea
    Eventually
